        Hello everyone! My name is Max and this is my website. My hobby is to make bets for eSports, such as Dota 2. Always, during periods I used to bet constantly, I was always storing some stats from my bets using google spreadsheets or similar software. However I always wanted to keep my betting history in somewhat more advanced envirotment, to draw some charts, pick some funny stats and control my spendings. Thats why I made this site(oh, and I also wanted to practice on Vue.JS, but thats another story). Feel free to use my website if you like it. I eventually will add more functionality. If you have some personal requests or probably want to contact with me, feel free to email me - <a href="mailto:maksym.fedan@gmail.com">maksym.fedan@gmail.com</a> <br/>
        Good luck betting!
